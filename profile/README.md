## General Info

REMEDi4ALL IS AN EU-FUNDED RESEARCH INITIATIVE TO DRIVE FORWARD THE REPURPOSING OF MEDICINES IN EUROPE.

The platform has the potential to bring down times and costs of drug development by focusing on already approved, discontinued, shelved or investigational therapeutics.

**Expertise and Collaboration**
The REMEDi4ALL consortium brings together a unique combination of expertise to address the complexities of drug repurposing. Under the leadership of EATRIS, the European infrastructure for translational medicine, 24 organizations in the fields of clinical and translational research, clinical operations, patient engagement and education, regulatory framework, funding, governance, Health Technology Assessment (HTA), and pricing and reimbursement will closely collaborate to make drug repurposing mainstream.

*It will receive 23M euros from Horizon Europe over the next 5 years*
